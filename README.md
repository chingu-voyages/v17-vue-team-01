## Description

This is an ongoing project with multiple purposes in mind.<br/>
First of all, we wanted to create an easy, simple way to schedule events/meetings for people in different timezones. <br/>
Secondly, this functions as a project to learn vue.js, a major frontend library, node.js as the backend and MongoDB as the database.<br/>If possible, this project will be constantly updated and will hopefully have new features in the future.
